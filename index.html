    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>My name is Fatima, and I'm currently learning software engineering. I love learn anything tech and I enjoy diving into new knowledge whenever I can. Outside of tech, I enjoy music, dancing, and working out. Nature (especially being near water) is my peace & reset, giving me the balance to grow and thrive. I love learning, exploring, and challenging myself to keep growing.  </p>
